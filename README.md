## Inspiration
Being a student can be lot of work. A full course load for an undergraduate student is anywhere between 12 - 18 credit hours. Most professors expect at least 3 hours of work per week, per credit hour. That is up to 54 hours a week of work! It can be overwhelming, but NeuraCoach is here to help.

## What it does
NeuraCoach is an interactive service that synthesizes a users list of tasks into a clear and concise task plan. This plan is generated to include the items a user needs to complete, as well as offer complementary tasks that can provide meaningful rests and buffers to the workload. Users are also able to log their mood and energy levels as they complete tasks, providing them with a valuable log, and the system with valuable data to adjust its suggestions to. 

## How we built it
On the frontend, we utilized the Streamlit platform for user interaction. This allowed us to use Python to create our frontend. On the backend, we used Python scripts to interface with Google Gemini 2.0 for task generation. This way, the task generation can be tuned to the users needs, and current wellbeing.
