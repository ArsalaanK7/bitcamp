**Morning (Energetic Mood):**

*   **Hydration & Fuel (7:00 AM):**
    *   **Action:** Start your day with a large glass of water (16 oz) with a squeeze of lemon. This rehydrates you after sleep and aids digestion.
    *   **Motivation:** Think of it as fueling your body's engine for a productive day!
    *   **Action:** Prepare a balanced breakfast. Example: Oatmeal with berries and nuts, or Greek yogurt with fruit and a sprinkle of granola.
    *   **Motivation:** A nutritious breakfast sets the tone for healthy choices throughout the day.
*   **Movement & Energy Boost (7:30 AM):**
    *   **Action:** Cardio Burst: 30-minute brisk walk, jog, or bike ride. Choose something you enjoy!
    *   **Motivation:** Embrace the energy! Feel the endorphins kick in and set a positive tone for the day.
    *   **Alternative (if short on time):** 15-minute high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout. Search for a beginner-friendly HIIT routine online.
